# MPMSimple
Simple mpm implmentation (material point method), this is a test project for the main branch of Waterflow3D.
The material point method is unusally good at handling multiphase and tearing for soils and materials.
MPM is a hybrid Euler-Laplacian method that retains the strong mass conservation of Laplace methods, with the ease of gradient calculation in Euler ones.

The program is written in c++ and outputs gifs of run time.

Here is an example output:
